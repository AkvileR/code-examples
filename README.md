# code-examples
Different snippets of code from multiple projects. 

## Assembly
Currently the examples of my Assembly programs are in lithuanian.

## Game
The **Game** folder contains a simple 2d platformer made in Processing. 
It has simple controls of *a, d* to move and *space* to jump.
Press *b* any time to return to the title screen.
